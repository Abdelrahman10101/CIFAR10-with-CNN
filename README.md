# CIFAR10-with-CNN

**CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project**  
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct categories, leveraging Python and deep learning frameworks like Pytorch.  
- Preprocessed image data, including normalization and augmentation, to enhance model generalization and performance.  
- Designed and trained a multi-layer CNN architecture, incorporating techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting and stabilize training.  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.
